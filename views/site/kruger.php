                    We get up early in the morning and enjoy a hot cup of coffee. We will start our safari while we witness the sunrise. The sound of the camera celebrates this special occasion as the morning offers a great photographic opportunity for us: nocturnal animals such as lions, jackals or hyenas, try to find their way back home. We will stop for breakfast and lunch at the next campsite or picnic spot. During our safari we will visit lakes, dams, hides to see and photograph aquatic species such as hippos, birds and crocodiles. Around sunset we check into a different camp, freshen up and dinner is served while star gazing, enjoying wine.

The Bush Walk begins at 5:30 am with a short sunrise ride to the hiking area. This incredible adventure gives us the opportunity to see little things that we miss while driving like trails, flowers, nests; We touch, we feel ... We will have many chances to meet elephants, lions, buffalo and even a rhinoceros. Breakfast awaits us when we return to the camp, followed by free time to take a nap, read a book, take a walk around the camp or visit the pool. After lunch we will take another game drive and after dinner, we will end our day with a night safari, Who knows! We can still witness the lion hunt.
